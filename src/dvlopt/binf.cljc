(defn buffer

  "Allocates a new buffer having `n-bytes` bytes.
  
   In Clojurescript, corresponds to a JS `ArrayBuffer`.

   In Clojure on the JVM, corresponds to a plain byte array.
  
   In order to do anything interesting with this library, it needs to be wrapped in a [[view]]."

  "Creates a growing view, starting with the given buffer.
  
   A growing view will reallocate a bigger buffer everytime it reaches the end of the current one.
  
   This is a simple strategy for when the size is unknown in advance, but it has proven to be rather optimal
   and ultimately efficient for the most common use cases. Even more so if the size can be roughly estimated.
  
   The size of the bigger buffer is decided by calling `next-size` which is a function `old-size` -> `new-size`.
   Thus the user can be in full control of the process. When not provided, size is always multiplied by 1.5."
