  "Handling 64-bit integers, miscellaneous coercions and unsigned math operations.
  
   64-bit integers deserves special attention. On the JVM, there is no explicit unsigned 64-bit
   type and in JS, there are no 64-bit integers at all. This is why creating and handling them in
   a cross-platform manner, signed or unsigned, is done via this namespace.
  
   On the JVM, unsigned 64-bit integers are actually regular 64-bit signed values but treated diffently.
   What matters is the bit pattern. For human-readability, see [[str-u]].
  
   In JS, they are `BigInt`, a type which does not even interoperate with regular numbers.
  
   As a rule, all values of any operation must be 64-bit integers. This namespace provides functions for
   logical and mathematical operations for which sign matters (such as [u<=]] or [[udiv]]) as well as
   bitwise operations which need an alternative implementation (such as [[bit-clear]]."
