(ns helins.binf.protocol

  "Protocols related to views.
  
   This namespace should be relevant only if a new type needs to implement those. The common user
   should not have to bother.
  
   Those functions are described in the core `helins.binf` namespace as well as in the README file.
  
   Depending on the type, not all protocols must be implemented. For instance, a stream-like type
   might not be seekable and might implement only `IRelative*` protocols and not `IAbsolute*` ones."
