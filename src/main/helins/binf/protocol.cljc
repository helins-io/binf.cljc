     a tuple indicating how many bytes and chars have been written, and if the process is finished:
     `[finished? n-byte n-chars]`.
    
     With that information, the user can continue writing if needed. On the JVM, the tuple contains a 4th
     item which is a `CharBuffer` containing the rest of the unwritten string which can be passed in place
     of the `string` argument.
